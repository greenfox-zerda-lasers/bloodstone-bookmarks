# BloodStone Bookmarks

An online bookmark manager webapp created by Team BloodStone of [Green Fox Academy](http://greenfoxacademy.com)'s 2016-2017 Junior Software Developer class, from the Lasers (Web Developer) group.

## About the project

The aim of the project was to acquire full stack web developer skills by making an online webapp that can handle users, serve protected views and save bookmarks to a live database that are retrievable and editable. 

The inspiration was from Pocket.com which is basically an article bookmarker. The project itself was carried out as an agile development in 1 week sprints with standups every 24 hour.

The development of the MVP product was done in roughly 6 weeks from mid-January to February 25, 2017. In this time the team members learned to use the stack (see below) and a bunch of new technologies.

## The stack

Full stack project with Node.js server, PassportJS authentication, PostgreSQL database and AngularJS 1 frontend. The app itself is single-page, deployed on Heroku from GitHub via Codeship.

Durint the development we set up a professional dev environment using webpack, eslint, and testing tools (Karma/Jasmine and Ava).

## The team

Project management, design was done by our lead instructor, [Anikó Fejes (hubudibu)](https://github.com/hubudibu).

The devteam had rotating roles so that everyone got involved in every technology. The coders were:
- [Bence Bednay (bednayb)](https://github.com/bednayb)
- [Tamás Czerjak (tamasc)](https://github.com/tamasc)
- [Gergő Vámosi (geritwo)](https://github.com/geritwo)

*Why the name BloodStone? Green Fox academy's color is, not surprisingly, green, so all project teams in the course had to choose a green crystal as their name. Bloodstone, or Heliotrope looks awesome - green stone with red patches - and also, sounds awesome, so we picked this.*
